### Information

This mod was mainly designed to allow streamers to increase enemy spawns as a challenge however there's probably other use cases as well, the things you can configure are:

- How many enemies spawn of each tier
- How long it takes for enemies to despawn if nobody is nearby
- How long it takes for enemies to respawn
- Which spawn groups should be disabled - for example `Enemy - Thin Man,Enemy - Slow Walker` would stop the shadow child and trudge from spawning

> Note: In multiplayer there is a limit of 1000 networked objects, if 900 objects is reached the mod will stop spawning enemies to prevent an exception happening!

### Enemy Spawn Groups

You can view the latest list of the latest enemy spawn groups at: https://1a3.uk/games/repo/diffs/beta?tab=3&tabEnemies=1

> Note: The spawn groups that start with "Enemy Group - " are excluded since they are just groups of enemies from the other tiers.
